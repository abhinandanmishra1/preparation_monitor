# About the project 

- This project is created to track the preparation for coding rounds and coding interviews.


## Features

- Create a gym by manually adding problems or automatically by fetching random problems of given difficulty level from leetcode and codeforces.

- User can create his/her account on preparation_monitor and should provide a user_name for this website so that tracking becomes easier.

- Each user will have to provide their leetcode or/and codeforces username to track their submissions or progress.



## Upcoming Features

- A discussion forum will be there for every gym where users can ask their doubts and get it resolved.
